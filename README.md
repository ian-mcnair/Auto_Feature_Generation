# Auto_Feature_Generation

Goal: Create a mini package that auto generates features and then selects/reduces them.

This is a possible spinoff from my masters project where I am currently creating NLP features based on any type of sentence for use in clustering. I am not sure when I will have a chance to actually start this, but wanted to create a repository to note it.
